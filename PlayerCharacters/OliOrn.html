  <h1>Oli Orn's Profile</h1>
  <hr size="3" noshade>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    Oli was born in a small Kobold mining village named RustRock. At a young age, Oli was always told to be a gifted child since he was seen as the incarnation of the Urd. <br> The legend of the Urd depicts that a winged Kobold will be born every
    thousand
    years among the Kobolds.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the Urd, Oli was always coddled and spoiled within the village as well as revered as one that could ascend to become a full dragon. Once Oli matured and his wings were fully grown, a strange power was born within him and he gained certain
    magical powers. Oli used his new found powers to help the village but at times his powers resulted in some mishaps. Although some negative results came from his continued use, the villagers never criticized Oli but always revered him.
  </p>
    When Oli reached adulthood, he traveled with a group of Kobolds that were trading with the Rustbeard dwarf clan. The Rustbeard clan was led by Brick Rustbeard who was a drunken rotund individual who mistreated anyone who isnâ€™t a dwarf. <br>
    The Rustbeards used faerie pseudodragons as tools for their mining expeditions. Oli, feeling bad for the pseudodragons, snuck in during the night and was able to free a small serpentine dragon that he named Bubbles.
  <p>
    Together Oli and Bubbles worked together to help the villages. Over time the village elders and its leader Snek felt that Oli had reached the limits of what he could do to help the village and they felt that he was destined for greater things as
    one who could become a dragon. <br> He embarked with Bubbles to join the adventurer guilds in Oldtown he heard so much about from the dwarves his village traded with.
