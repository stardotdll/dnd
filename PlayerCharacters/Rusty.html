    Rusty was taken in by the children of a renowned paladin named Fiona Dawnward. Peter and Lily had offered him some milk and cared for the young kitten. As time passed, Rusty swore loyalty to this family and vowed to protect them at all cost.
    Rusty had noticed that the children's father was never around. Connor Dawnward ran out on them after the youngest of the two Lily was born and they never knew why. Fiona was stuck raising two children while taking care of her duties as a paladin.
    Luckily she had the help of her elderly mother Julie Dawnward.
  </p>

  <p>
    One night, when Fiona was away on a mission, a group of bandits knocked on Dawnward's abode and as Julie opened they simply barged in. They screamed at the elderly woman asking for anything valuable in the house. Julie was frightened and
    explained that there was nothing worth stealing and asked what this was about. The bandits told her that they were here to settle Connor's debt and sought payment. It was clear that Connor had directed them towards the house.

  <p>
    The bandit realizing there was nothing of value to steal saw the two small children and decided to kidnap them instead and told Julie that if she wants to see them again, she will need to settle Connor's debt.

    Rusty at this time tried to defend the children against their kidnapped but small cat was swiftly dealt with. The bandits left with the children and Rusty was left defeated licking his wounds as Julie sobbed.


    Eventually Fiona had returned from her mission and learned of what transpired that night and immediately set off to rescue her children. Rusty wished to follow Fiona but she told him to quietly stay here and wait for her to return with the
    children. She gave him a Toy Bell as a distraction. During the night Rusty was fiddling with the bell making it ring over and over. The sound had changed him and he had become awakened. At that moment Rusty decided to set off in search of his
    masters. He dawned an armor kit that the children had given him to dress up as a paladin with a small shield and sword. He then set out.

  <h1>Historical Events</h1>
  <h2>Curse of Strahd</h2>
  <p>
    Rusty was transported to Barovia mysteriously by Strahd Von Zarovich, where he met other awakened animals such as Booch, Lil'Ray, Azoth, Bud, Steeple and Toby. Also a human bloodhunter named Ana was part of his group. Rusty would partake in the events leading up
    from his first encounter with the Jabbering Mouther in the death house, to the killing of a shadow dragon or even the defeat of the Abbot. Eventually, making his way around Barovia, Rusty had become incredibly addicted to the Hag's dreampies and could not live without
    them at all. This would forever haunt Rusty until he made a deal with the dark power Tarakemedes to enable him to taste bone as dreampies and also gave him the power of flight.
  </p>
  <p>
    Eventually, Rusty and the Ratatouille troupe slayed Strahd and he was able to return to his home with his family Fiona, Lily and Peter. He now spends most days helping Fiona with her job as a paladin of the Dawn. He still has the skeletal wings and the red eyes from his
    adventure in Barovia. But he still tries to do good.
