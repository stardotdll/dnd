      <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
      <p>Torinn and Surina were found as hatchlings on the outskirts of a Myastan clan's village. They grew up thinking they were Myastan clan members, learning the ways of the Myastan. On the eve of their 15th birthday, the Shestendeliath clan
        showed
        up, led by their leader, Balasar. He claimed that the two children were Shestendeliath members that were abandoned by their traitorous parents and that Myastan clan had taken what was rightful property of the Shestendeliath. They had a
        choice:
        either hand the children over or watch their village burn to the ground.</p>
      <p>After a small skirmish, it was clear that the Myastan clan were the superior fighters. Several Shestendeliath warriors lay slain, felled at the hands of Surina. Balasar, now enraged, played his trump card. Blowing on a horn, an artillery
        barrage
        decimated the village, killing many of the Myastan clan instantly. The clan leader pleaded with Balasar to stop. Seeing the severity of the situation, Surina agreed to go with the Shestendeliath. Satisfied with this result, Balasar agreed to
        leave the village.</p>
      <p>Moments after the last of the invaders had left, Balasar blew on the horn again. Destruction again rained down on the Myastan village, reducing it to rubble. Hours later, Torinn awoke to find nothing and no one left in the Myastan village.
        He
        was devastated. Not only had he lost his home, but his best friend had agreed to denounce the people who raised and join the enemy. He packed what little he could find, grabbed the village's greatest treasure, the great sword Vyrakyn and left
        his
        home. Torinn wandered for nearly three weeks, scavenging what he could from the land, until a chance encounter with an Elf named Arannis along the river north of the Far Forest changed the young dragonborn's fate in ways he couldn't imagine.
      </p>
      <p>Arannis, or Master Nai'lo as Torinn called him, took the young dragon under his proverbial wing, teaching him many new things. Through his wisdom, Master Nai'lo helped Torinn deal with his trauma, to an extent. Torinn still grapples with his
        hatred of Balasar and thirst for vengeance but he has learned to control his feelings… for the most part. Working with the elves of the Far Forest, Torinn gained a new sense of self-worth, helping with any task, regardless of how menial it
        seemed. On the morning of his seventeenth birthday, Torinn was summoned by Master Nai'lo. An unexpected job had come to the Elf's attention and Torinn, it seemed, was the perfect candidate for the task…</p>
      <h3 id="lostminesofphandelver">Lost Mines of Phandelver</h3>
      <p>Torinn took on the job of delivering a cart of supplies for a wealthy dwarf prospector named Gundren Rockseeker. While traveling towards their destination of Phandalin, Torinn and his companions Arya and Bertaro encountered a group of goblin
        amidst the scene of a successful ambush. Torinn bravely slayed the goblin and this set off the events of related to the Lost Mines of Phandelver. Upon his arrival to Phandalin, Torinn befriended Elyel Gwamiel a narcoleptic studious elf wizard
        who
        was perform research in the surrounding area around Phandalin.</p>
      <p>During his quest to rid the town of the Redcloaks, Torinn fell unconscious after the battle with Glasstaff, the leader of the Redcloaks. Upon awakening Torinn gained peculiar powers to wild echoes of time.</p>
      <p>Following his return to Phandalin after rescuing Gundren, Torinn help defeat the remnants of the Redcloaks still occupying the Sleeping Giant Tavern. At the end of the battle as the tavern was engulfed in flames. Torinn’s vision blurred and
        saw
        visions of his home village of Myastan. When the vision subsided Torinn’s scales had become fully golden, a mask adorned his face and his greatsword Vyrakyn had been reforged into two armblades.</p>
